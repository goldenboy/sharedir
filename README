# Description

$ sharedir is a command-line tool for sharing the current directory in your Terminal over HTTP.

You just do a $ cd over the directory you wanna share, run $ sharedir and you're done. All the files in this folder are now shared.

Just go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser and browse your files like a boss. Or tell a friend to visit your IP at the port 8000, something like 192.168.0.10:8000, and share your files easily.

# Installation

$ sharedir is distributed over homebrew, the most awesome package manager for OS X. Just install homebrew in your Mac, run $ brew install sharedir, restart Terminal and go nuts.

In case you can't see $ sharedir in Homebrew, update the list of available packages with the command $ brew update and then install $ sharedir with $ brew install sharedir

If you not using Homebrew (which you really should, btw) you can download $ sharedir, extract it and place it on the folder /usr/bin along with your other CLI tools.
